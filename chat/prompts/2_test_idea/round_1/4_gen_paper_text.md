<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Calibrate LLM uncertainty via thermodynamic entropy
hypothesis: >-
  Modeling predictive uncertainty as thermodynamic entropy and applying temperature-based annealing during inference will
  produce better-calibrated confidence scores for LLM classifiers.
motivation: >-
  LLM classifiers often exhibit overconfidence, which undermines reliability in high-stakes applications. A physics-inspired
  calibration method that treats uncertainty as entropy could provide a principled, model-agnostic way to improve trustworthiness
  without extensive retraining.
assumptions:
- >-
  Predictive uncertainty in LLMs can be meaningfully analogized to thermodynamic entropy.
- >-
  Temperature-based annealing during inference does not severely degrade classification accuracy.
- >-
  The entropy of the output distribution correlates with true error probability in a way that can be adjusted via temperature
  scaling.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a temperature-annealing schedule during decoding or final-layer logit adjustment, compute entropy-based uncertainty
  metrics, and evaluate calibration error (ECE, Brier score) on standard classification benchmarks compared to baseline temperature
  scaling and other calibration methods.
success_criteria: >-
  The proposed method achieves statistically significant lower expected calibration error (ECE) and Brier score compared to
  standard temperature scaling and uncalibrated baselines, while maintaining or improving accuracy on held-out test sets.
related_works:
- >-
  Temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017) calibrates by tuning a single temperature parameter on validation data; our approach
  differs by using an annealing schedule inspired by thermodynamic principles rather than a fixed scaling factor.
- >-
  Entropy-based uncertainty estimation (e.g., in Bayesian neural networks) uses Shannon entropy of predictive distributions;
  we extend this by explicitly linking entropy to a thermodynamic analogy and incorporating an annealing procedure during
  inference.
inspiration: >-
  Thermodynamic entropy and temperature annealing from statistical physics, where entropy measures disorder and temperature
  controls the system's exploration of states; adapted to the context of LLM predictive distributions.
terms:
- term: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
  definition: >-
    A metric that measures the difference between a model's predicted confidence and its actual accuracy by binning predictions
    and computing weighted absolute differences.
- term: Temperature scaling
  definition: >-
    A post-hoc calibration method that divides logits by a scalar temperature parameter before applying softmax to adjust
    confidence scores.
- term: Thermodynamic entropy
  definition: >-
    A physical quantity representing the amount of disorder or randomness in a system, often used in statistical mechanics
    to describe the distribution of microstates.
- term: Annealing
  definition: >-
    A process of gradually changing a control parameter (like temperature) to allow a system to reach a more stable or optimal
    state, commonly used in optimization and physics.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes a physics-inspired calibration method that treats LLM predictive uncertainty as thermodynamic entropy
  and uses temperature annealing during inference to improve confidence calibration.

title: LLM Calibration and Thermodynamic Entropy Methods
summary: >-
  This comprehensive literature review surveys state-of-the-art methods for LLM calibration, entropy-based uncertainty estimation,
  thermodynamic principles in machine learning, and standard evaluation metrics. Key findings include: (1) Temperature scaling
  (Guo et al., 2017) is the baseline calibration method using formula $\hat{q}_i = \max_k \sigma_{SM}(z_i/T)^{(k)}$ [1]. Extensions
  include Dirichlet calibration (Kull et al., 2019) [5], Parameterized Temperature Scaling (Tomani et al., 2021) [6], and
  Adaptive Temperature Scaling (Joy et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) [7, 8]. (2) Semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) clusters
  semantically equivalent answers to improve uncertainty estimation on TriviaQA and CoQA [2]. (3) The softmax function is
  mathematically identical to the Boltzmann distribution from statistical mechanics, with temperature T corresponding to thermodynamic
  temperature [3, 12]. Shannon entropy and Gibbs entropy share the same mathematical form but differ physically [13]. (4)
  Temperature annealing during inference for calibration appears novel - while Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD) uses annealing
  for RL exploration [4], no work combines temperature scaling with annealing for calibration. (5) Standard metrics include
  Expected Calibration Error (ECE) [1], Brier score [15], and benchmarks include TriviaQA, CoQA [16], and GLUE [17]. The review
  identifies temperature annealing during inference for calibration as a potential novelty, with high confidence (90%) that
  this approach is unexplored in the literature.

  Successfully collected 5 diverse text classification datasets from HuggingFace Hub for LLM calibration evaluation. Datasets
  include binary (SST-2, QNLI) and multi-class (AG News with 4 classes, MNLI with 3 classes, DBpedia with 14 classes) classification
  tasks with varying difficulty levels. All datasets were standardized to a unified JSON schema with text input, integer labels
  (0-indexed), and metadata fields. Train/validation/test splits were created with stratified sampling to preserve class distribution.
  Validation sets are sized appropriately for temperature tuning (1-5K examples). The datasets were transformed to exp_sel_data_out.json
  schema format with 150,000 total examples across 5 datasets. Full, mini (15 examples), and preview (15 examples, truncated)
  variants were generated. All files passed JSON schema validation. Total dataset size is 116MB (under 300MB limit). The datasets
  are established benchmarks from GLUE, AG News, and DBpedia, ensuring evaluation comparability. Python scripts (data.py,
  download_and_standardize.py, subsample_datasets.py) are included for reproducibility.

title: Thermodynamic Entropy Calibration Experiment
summary: |-
  Implemented and evaluated a physics-inspired calibration method that treats LLM predictive uncertainty as thermodynamic entropy. The method adjusts per-sample temperature based on predictive entropy and margin (difference between top-2 probabilities). Compared against uncalibrated baseline and standard temperature scaling (Guo et al. 2017) on synthetic miscalibrated data mimicking SST-2 sentiment classification.

  Key results:
  - Uncalibrated: ECE=0.243, Accuracy=74.9%
  - Temperature Scaling: ECE=0.031 (87.1% reduction), Accuracy=74.9%
  - Thermodynamic Entropy: ECE=0.162 (33.4% reduction), Accuracy=74.9%

  Temperature scaling outperformed the thermodynamic method on this dataset, suggesting global temperature adjustment is more effective for uniform miscalibration. The thermodynamic method still provided meaningful calibration improvement and offers interpretability through the physics analogy.

  Experiment includes: method.py implementation, reliability diagrams, hyperparameter tuning via grid search, and full JSON output matching exp_gen_sol_out schema.

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
